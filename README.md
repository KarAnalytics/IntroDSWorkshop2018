Data is ubiquitous. There is enormous business value in processing and analyzing data. No wonder that data scientists have the hottest jobs of this century. Using the right tools, data science helps to make informed decisions with quantifiable evidence. 

Learn about data science and the typical skillsets required for data scientist roles in order to fine-tune your skills before seeking data science internships and jobs. The workshop will cover some basic skills in programming, analysis, and presenting your results followed by a narrow-down into the topic of text mining.

This is a MISGA event presented by Karthik Srinivasan, Jiaheng Xie (Senior PhD students in the MIS Department).
